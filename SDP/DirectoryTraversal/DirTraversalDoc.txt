		Coppies rhs_path into the path member and sets the size member to be equal to the file size.
	-file_data(const file_data& rhs)
		Coppies the path and size from rhs into the current file_data objects path and size members.
	-operator=(const file_data& rhs)
		Coppies the path and size from rhs into the current file_data objects path and size members.	
	-set_path(const char * rhs_path)
		Coppies rhs_path into the path member and sets the size member to be equal to the file size.
